Here is the hobby 2-day project.
I created a history app that can display topics and information for each topic based on the data inputted in Excel spreadsheet. 
It supports title texts, ordinary texts, buttons, and images as data inputs. 
Also, there is a simple testing page, which is also implemented through Excel.
Furthermore, there is "Ask GPT" function that I kindly "stole" from GeeksForGeeks (reference is in the file).
